<p>In Year 11, the primary focus in on part 2 component of the paper: Programming and Algorithms. Students are expected to learn the following concepts:</p>
<strong><h3>2.1 Algorithms</h3></strong>
<p><strong>Computational Thinking: </strong>Computational thinking principles encompass various strategies crucial for problem-solving in computer science. These include abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking, which aid in breaking down complex problems into manageable components and devising effective solutions. In the process of designing, creating, and refining problems, it's essential to identify inputs, processes, and outputs, employing structured diagrams to visualize problem structures. Furthermore, algorithms are created, refined, and corrected using methods like pseudocode, flowcharts, and high-level programming languages, allowing for precise and systematic problem-solving. Common errors are identified and rectified through techniques such as trace tables, enhancing algorithm accuracy and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Algorithms: </strong>In the realm of searching and sorting algorithms, various standard methods are employed to organize and retrieve data efficiently. Standard searching algorithms like binary and linear search enable the systematic retrieval of information from datasets, catering to different search requirements. Similarly, standard sorting algorithms including bubble sort, merge sort, and insertion sort facilitate the organization of data into desired sequences, each offering unique advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability. Mastery of these algorithms equips computer scientists with powerful tools for navigating and manipulating data effectively, optimizing computational processes across diverse applications.</p>
<strong><h3>2.2 Programming Techniques</h3></strong>
<p><strong>Programming Basics and Data Types: </strong>Utilising variables, constants, operators, inputs, outputs, and assignments forms the foundational aspects of programming, facilitating data manipulation and computation within software systems. Moreover, mastering the three fundamental programming constructs—sequence, selection, and iteration—empowers programmers to control the flow of their programs efficiently. Sequence dictates the linear execution of commands, while selection enables conditional branching based on logical evaluations, and iteration, encompassing count- and condition-controlled loops, facilitates repetitive tasks execution. Understanding and effectively implementing these constructs are essential for developing structured and functional programs.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Programming Techniques and SQL: </strong>Furthermore, comprehending various data types such as integer, real, boolean, character, and string, along with techniques like casting, enhances the versatility and robustness of programming solutions. Employing basic string manipulation and file handling operations—including opening, reading, writing, and closing files—enables efficient data processing and management. Leveraging records for data storage and utilizing SQL for data retrieval are additional programming techniques vital for effective data handling. Moreover, the utilization of arrays, both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D), aids in organizing and accessing data efficiently. Lastly, mastering subprograms like functions and procedures facilitates the development of structured and modular code, while understanding random number generation enables the creation of dynamic and unpredictable program behaviours.</p>
<strong><h3>2.3 Producing Robust Programs</h3></strong>
<p><strong>Defensive Design: </strong>Involves planning and implementing strategies to ensure software operates correctly and securely under various conditions, including potential misuse. Key considerations include anticipating how users might misuse the system, implementing authentication to verify user identities, and validating inputs to prevent incorrect or harmful data from entering the system. Maintainability is also crucial; this involves writing clear and organized code using subprograms, following consistent naming conventions, applying proper indentation, and adding comments to make the code easier to understand and modify in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Testing: </strong>This is essential for verifying that software functions correctly and efficiently. It includes various types of testing, such as iterative testing, which is conducted throughout the development process, and final or terminal testing, which occurs after development is complete. Testing aims to identify and fix syntax and logic errors. Effective testing involves selecting suitable test data, including normal data for expected input ranges, boundary data for edge cases, and invalid or erroneous data to test the system's robustness. Refining algorithms through rigorous testing ensures they perform accurately and efficiently under all anticipated conditions.</p>
<strong><h3>2.4 Boolean Logic</h3></strong>
<p>Boolean logic involves creating simple logic diagrams using the operators AND, OR, and NOT, and representing these operations with truth tables. It includes combining these Boolean operators to form more complex expressions and using truth tables to solve logical problems by applying these operators systematically.</p>
<strong><h3>2.5 Programming languages and IDEs</h3></strong>
<p><strong>Low and High Levels: </strong>Programming languages vary in their characteristics and purposes, with distinctions between high-level and low-level languages. High-level languages, like Python and Java, are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, featuring strong abstraction from machine language. In contrast, low-level languages, such as assembly language, provide closer control over hardware and are more challenging to learn and use. Translators, including compilers and interpreters, are crucial for converting high-level code into machine-readable instructions. Compilers translate the entire program at once, generating an executable file, while interpreters translate and execute code line-by-line, facilitating easier debugging.</p>
<p><strong>IDE: </strong>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive software suite that provides tools and facilities to assist in software development. Common features of an IDE include editors for writing and modifying code, error diagnostics to identify and help correct coding errors, and a run-time environment for testing and executing programs. Additionally, IDEs often include built-in translators, such as compilers and interpreters, to streamline the coding process by enabling quick translation and execution of code within the same environment.</p>
